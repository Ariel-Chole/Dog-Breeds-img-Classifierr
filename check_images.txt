Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The architecture classify both image 1 and 2 of dogs as "alsatian", which I provided correctly.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 3 out of 4 sample replacing with different images of flipped orientation, correctly classifies as I tries. However, I have doubts on Alex and Resnet architectures after overall evaluation for total matrix, I think we should try with more images in this case or retrain with inverted images.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Most of the times, they correctly classify Dog vs non Dog Images, However, consecutive runs have incorrect variation in case of "resnet" architecture of animal, which I saw in consecutive re-runs (just once). I hope I can have your advice on that matter in your review of my work, hoping you would read this.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Even after third try, VGG architecture is the best performing one, as you can see in this workspace results,( alex=80%,resnet=90%,VGG=93% ), in case you cant access here is the brief result of VGG
